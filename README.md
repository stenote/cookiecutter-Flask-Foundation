#Cookiecutter Flask Lite

This is the Cookiecutter fork of [Flask Foundation](https://github.com/JackStouffer/Flask-Foundation).

Flask Foundation is a solid foundation for flask applications, built with best practices, that you can easily construct your website/webapp off of. Flask Foundation is different from most Flask frameworks as it does not assume anything about your development or production environments. Flask Foundation is platform agnostic in this respect.
